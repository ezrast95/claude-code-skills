# [Output Type] Generator

Automated generation of [specific output type] following [standards/patterns].

## When to Use

This skill activates when:
- User wants to create/generate [output type]
- User mentions: [trigger word 1], [trigger word 2], [trigger word 3]
- Context involves [specific scenarios]

## Generation Process

### Step 1: Gather Requirements

Ask the user for:

1. **[Requirement 1]**: [What information is needed]
   - Default: [default value if any]
   - Examples: [examples]

2. **[Requirement 2]**: [What information is needed]
   - Options: [A/B/C]
   - Recommendation: [suggested option]

3. **[Requirement 3]**: [What information is needed]

### Step 2: Select Template

Based on requirements, choose from:

- **Template A**: [When to use this]
  - Best for: [use case]
  - Features: [what it includes]

- **Template B**: [When to use this]
  - Best for: [use case]
  - Features: [what it includes]

- **Template C**: [When to use this]
  - Best for: [use case]
  - Features: [what it includes]

### Step 3: Customize Content

Apply customizations:

1. **[Customization 1]**: [How to apply user's input]
2. **[Customization 2]**: [How to apply user's input]
3. **[Customization 3]**: [How to apply user's input]

### Step 4: Generate Output

Create the output file(s):

1. Determine output location:
   - Default: `[default path]`
   - Ask user if they want different location

2. Generate file(s) with complete content:
   - No placeholders or TODOs
   - Production-ready code/content
   - Proper formatting and style

3. Add supporting files if needed:
   - [Supporting file 1]
   - [Supporting file 2]

### Step 5: Explain and Next Steps

Provide:
1. Summary of what was created
2. How to use/customize it
3. Suggested next steps
4. Related documentation

## Best Practices

- Generate complete, production-ready content
- Follow project conventions and patterns
- Include helpful comments/documentation
- No placeholders - everything should work
- Validate output before saving

## Templates

### Template A: [Name]

```[language]
[Complete template content with placeholders clearly marked]
```

**Placeholders:**
- `{{PLACEHOLDER_1}}`: [Description of what goes here]
- `{{PLACEHOLDER_2}}`: [Description of what goes here]

### Template B: [Name]

```[language]
[Complete template content]
```

**Placeholders:**
- `{{PLACEHOLDER_1}}`: [Description]
- `{{PLACEHOLDER_2}}`: [Description]

## Examples

### Example 1: [Common Scenario]

**User Request:**
```
Generate a [specific output] for [purpose]
```

**Gathering Requirements:**
```
Q: [Requirement question 1]?
A: [User answer]

Q: [Requirement question 2]?
A: [User answer]
```

**Generated Output:**

File: `[path/to/file]`
```[language]
[Complete example of generated output]
```

**Explanation:**
- [What was created]
- [Key features included]
- [How to use it]

### Example 2: [Another Scenario]

**User Request:**
```
Create [different output type]
```

**Generated Output:**

File: `[path/to/file]`
```[language]
[Complete example]
```

## Customization Options

Users can customize:

1. **[Option 1]**: [What can be customized]
   - How: [How to specify]
   - Effect: [What changes]

2. **[Option 2]**: [What can be customized]
   - How: [How to specify]
   - Effect: [What changes]

3. **[Option 3]**: [What can be customized]
   - How: [How to specify]
   - Effect: [What changes]

## Quality Checklist

Before saving generated content, verify:

- [ ] All placeholders replaced with actual values
- [ ] Syntax is valid for the language/format
- [ ] Follows project conventions (naming, style)
- [ ] Includes necessary imports/dependencies
- [ ] Comments/documentation are clear
- [ ] No TODO or placeholder comments
- [ ] Ready to use without modification

## Security Considerations

- Don't include hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Validate user inputs before using in templates
- Follow secure coding practices for language
- Document any security considerations for users

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: Generated code has syntax errors
**Solution**: Validate templates before using, test with example data

**Issue**: Output doesn't match project style
**Solution**: Check existing files for patterns, ask user for style preferences

**Issue**: Missing required dependencies
**Solution**: Include dependency installation instructions, check package.json/requirements.txt
